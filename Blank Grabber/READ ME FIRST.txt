How to use:-

1) Install virtualenv by using "pip install virtualenv".
2) Open cmd in current dir and type "virtualenv env" and let it complete and close cmd.
3) Open "config.txt" in "Data" folder and replace "WEBHOOK_URL" with your webhook.
4) Copy all the files from "Data" folder to "Scripts" folder in "env" folder. (Do NOT copy the folder itself)
5) Type "run" in the address bar of the "Scripts" folder and wait for the process to complete.
6) When the process complete, a new folder will open containing the grabber.
